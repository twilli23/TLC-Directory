    Welcome to the Directory for the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (SoTL) at West Virginia University. 
  </h2>
  <p>
    It is a collaborative effort between the Teaching and Learning Commons and Libraries. This directory introduces you to scholars on campus who conduct research on teaching and learning and publish in peer-reviewed publications. We created this resource so that SoTL researchers can learn about each otherâ€™s scholarly work on teaching and learning and build collaboration at WVU.

  <p>
    If you conduct scholarly research on teaching and learning and would like to be included in this directory, please
